        <h3>Pairing and Giving Feedback</h3>
        <h4>October 16, 2014</h4>
        <p>
Pairing:

What was it like to pair with others to solve challenges?
Was something particularly fun or rewarding?
Was something frustrating and difficult for you?

Pairing-programming is very important part of the learn-to-code experience. It enables one to see which parts of the coding are their strengths and weaknesses. I like to pair with others to solve challenges because it enables me to teach others what I am knowledgable and learn materials that my pair is comfortable with. It is a win-win situation.

While pair-programming can be frustrating and difficult in the sense that one has to get out of their comfort zone, however it is rewarding when we are able to solve a coding challenge. 

Feedback:

How did you feel when you read your feedback?
Was the feedback you received helpful to your learning?
Based on the feedback you've received, what are you going to do to improve next time you pair?
How was it to write feedback?
What was most difficult for you when writing feedback for your pair?
Overall, what do you think of using pairing and feedback to guide your learning?

When I read the feedback, I feel that I need to try harder. Yes, while the feedbacks were mostly satisfactory, I need to focus because there is always more room for improvement. 

One common feedback was the need to effectively express my thoughts and communicate. This feedback helps me because I have a bad habit of stuttering, which induces me to choose short and easy words to speak. Googling taught me that I need to speak with greater patience and confidence, which I will work on!

I think it becomes more difficult to write feedback because there are repetitive words and as the weeks progress, everyone improves and has less suggestions to make. However, just as pair-programming, the pros outweight the cons. We are able to gain a kind and actionable feedbacks which allows one person to see their flaws.
