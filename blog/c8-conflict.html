        <h3>Compass of Shame</h3>
        <h4>November 7, 2014</h4>
        <p>
Compass of Shame is a term developed by Dr. Sylvan Tompkins, where he investigated infants about the emotional impact and actions from feeling shame. There are 9 innate emotions which are: Joy, Excitement, Startle, Fear, Disgust, Dissmell, Rage, Despair and Shame. Shame is a dangerous emotion where one can respond to "Compass of Shame". Compass of Shame consists of withdrawl, attacking others, avoidance and attacking self. Each of the symptoms cause significant damage to the individual and others around them, thus one has be cautious about one's emotions.

I recently had a self-emotional conflict where after I finished my education, I went into withdrawal, isolating myself by going to America. I ran and hid from pressures inSeoul, Korea where my family, friends, and peers were asking about my future. The source of the conflict was that I had a internal struggle of working full time at a company or following my instinct of finding a new career path that would make me happy. I felt ashamed that my fellow peers got jobs at prestigious companies and I was still unemployed. I handled the conflict by realizing that I needed to self-improve by learning new set of skills and meet great people to broaden my perspective. The best solution I came up was to apply for DEV Bootcamp. 

Taking a risk to join DEV Bootcamp was the best solution that I could think of at the time, and is still the best solution that my logic accepts. If I could go back in time, I would not isolate myself from my family and friends and ask for advice. From reading compass of shame and relating the materials to my experience, I was not a good friend or peer. I put-down myself for no reason and hid from all the pressures. Human-beings are social animals and I have to accept that I cannot solve all the problems by myself and must ask for help.

I am very grateful that I have great people to depend on and would like to become a better person for the greater good of the society.
