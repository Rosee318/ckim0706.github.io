What does it mean to display inline vs inline blocks?

Only those who stumbled upon my blog would see this! Possibly. 
The answer to this requires numerous details and I decided that this post would go brief and provide the best links that I studied. 

Every element of the html and css has its each display property. Inline are those such as strong, em, anchor(a href), etc., where properties are placed within block-elements. Then whats block-element? Blocks are those that like its name, blocks that stack itself. It is like a paragraph in html and essays. You write one paragraph and you space it for the next paragraph. Thus, inline blocks are blocks that have the characteristics to stack block-elements side by side.
