        <h3>Stereotype Threat</h3>
        <h4>October 24, 2014</h4>
        <p>
Stereotype Threat is a important social problem that has been unnoticed although it has consequences that deter the full potential of a person. Academically, it refers to being at risk of confirming, as self-characteristic, a negative stereotype about one's group. Professor Steel first coined the term in 1995, where he conducted several experiments on black and white college students to take on standarized tests where contents were race emphasized. The results showed that academic contexts can harm performance of test takers by increasing racial stereotypes.

Simply explained, people will underperform in tests and social situations if they feel uncomfortable. 

While the experiment was conducted for standarized tests and college students, the performance results can be replicated between different sex, workplaces and social situations. Thus, it is important to create an organization where stereotypes are discredited and members are acknowledged as equal peers. There should be programs created by Human Resources to recognize such a threat which may hinder personal and organizational growth.
