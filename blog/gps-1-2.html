        <h3>Pair Programming and its roles</h3>
        <h4>October 2, 2014</h4>
        <p>
What is pair programming?

Pair programming is an activity of working together with another developer. This is an important people-working-skill because one is able to develop clear communication skills to represent their work.

Why is pair programming important to DBC?

DBC is a experimental academic institution where one is free to learn as much as they want. Pair programming is an important tool for students to check where they are within the learning process. They are able to ask questions on the materials they do not know and get feed back right away. Most importantly, people do not slack off when they have another person watching YOU!!

Comparing Driver and Navigator

Diver and Navigator are two roles within the pair programming activity. While the terms clearly define the difference in the roles, actually, they are not that different. They both must be active bouncing off ideas for successful results.
