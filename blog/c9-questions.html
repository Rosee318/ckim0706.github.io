        <h3>Asking Good Questions</h3>
        <h4>November 15, 2014</h4>
        <p>
Questions are important thought process that results in sharing and learning knowledge. Eversince we are a child, we ask questions to learn something new and to ask for favors, etc. Before the advancement of technology, the most common medium was face-to-face. 

However, nowadays we consume most of our information through endless characters of texts through the screens. Thus, important body language and timing them is ommited in the process. To overcome the medium barrier, this post would like to summarize techniques that can be helpful in asking questions on the internet.

Since title is the first contact to answerees, it must precisely describe the problem.
Ex: What is the shorten version of if/else statement?

Context must be clarified such as the language and platform of the problem. 
Ex: Ruby on Mac Mavericks Version 10.10

Be kind and polite. Most answerees spend their personal time to read and answer your problems. 

Many of the communities that we are going to ask questions on: Google/Community, Quora, Stackoverflow has buttons like that of "Like" in Facebook. It is great to use them to encourage answerees and to share that information to future questionees.
