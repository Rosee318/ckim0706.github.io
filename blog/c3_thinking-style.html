        <h3>Personal Thinking Style</h3>
        <h4>October 5, 2014</h4>
        <p>
As mentioned in the previous post, Dev Bootcamp is not a traditional academic institution. It is a big experiment to test whether a intensive course can educate the participant just enough to be hired as a junior developer. Thus, while cirriculum is rigorious, it is up to one to sit down and study. 

A popular method to test how one thinks is created by Gregorc, Ph. D, where he divided mind styles into perceptual quality: concrete and abstract and ordering ability: sequntial and random. My thinking style is concrete sequential and concrete random. 

Concrete sequential thinkers process information in a logical way using physical senses. Breaking projects into steps in a quiet environment with hands-on experience is the most efficient way to study.

Concrete random thinkers are experimenters who makes intuitive leaps necessary for creative thoughts and hands-on experience. It is recommended for to see from more various perspective while solving projets with a deadline.

Looking back upon the 3 weeks of phase 0, my thinking style has been effective. Seperating myself in a quiet environment with online courses and pair-programming helps me to exemplify my learning experience.
