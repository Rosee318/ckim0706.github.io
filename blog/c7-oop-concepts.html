        <h3>Affirmation and Stereotype Threat</h3>
        <h4>November 1, 2014</h4>
        <p>
When you think of the times in your life where youâ€™ve been the happiest, the proudest, or the most satisfied, which of the following values come to mind?

While there are numerous vocabularies that describe myself, the keystone values that describe myself are Challenge, Growth and Wisdom. 

I chose these values because it describes my life and the future path I dream. In general, I try to adhere to the values.

Challenge means to get out of my comfort zone to adapt to new environments and have an positive learning experience. An example of taking challenge is applying to DBC. DBC curriculum pushes me outside of my normal boundaries to work with others.

Growth refers to how I evolve to become a better person and a better worker for the society. Whatever I do, I believe that I need to grow to develop my current and new skills.

Wisdom is the last important value for me because it represents how I can take a problem and use my previous experiences to wisely deduct the situation for a better solution. 

What was the last topic that someone asked for your advice on?

The last advice that my friend asked me was preparing for his job interview and wanted ideas for improvement. My recommendation was to be confident and enunciate to showcase his full potential.

How do you feel when you think about your values? Do you think it can help you mediate stereotype threat if you recognize you feel it?

I feel satisfied about the values that I chose. These values definitely mediate stereotype threat because, reducing one's knowledge and skills based on first impression and ethnicity is not justified. 

Can you think of any other exercises you can use to help you when you are feeling down (for whatever reason) at DBC?

The best method to become energetic and raise one's mood is to release dopamine. One way I reduce stress is to exercise in the outdoors, preferable when sunny. I highly recommend this simple yet hard-to-do exercise.
