        <p><span id="question">
          What's your take on the DBC experience? <br>
          What is your impression of DBC? <br> 
          How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture? <br>
          Have your expectations of DBC changed? If so, how? <br>
          Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? <br>
          Does it make you nervous? </span><br>

          After watching the video by Shereef (http://vimeo.com/85001014), I have greater respect for DEV Bootcamp. Many difficult questions and their solutions were shown. Shereef emphasizes social empathy, passionate, humbleness, confidence, hunger and commitment as important characteristics of great learners and team member. Dev Bootcamp isn't a traditional academic institute, where simple question and answer situations are given. Just like working in the restaurant, one must pull your sleeves up and take action for your learning experience. No one can change one's destiny but oneself. An action speaks louder than a thousand words. Everyone should be in the creator mindset to change the environment they are in to have a great learning experience. No one is perfect and everyone came here to learn from scratch. I am excited to join a great organization where mistakes are acknowledged as a part of learning process.</p>
