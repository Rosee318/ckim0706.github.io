        <h3>Issues in Technology Industry</h3>
        <h4>October 6, 2014</h4>
        <p>
In the 21st century, technology industry has become the go-to field for college students and career development. Technology industry is a broad term in that technology has penetrated our every day lives from smartphones to how we work. Furthermore, technology has been the sole catalyst for exponential growth of start up companies and new business models such as freemium and bundling, which enabled greater division of wealth. 

One of the biggest issues within the technology industry was "Productivity Paradox" which was termed by Professor Erik Brynjolfsson at MIT in 1993. Productivity paradox describes how advancement of computer power and growth of productivity is inversely correlated. Hence, even though companies spent millions of dollars, there was no gain in from the investments. While this problem has been alleviated due to training to maximize technology investments and through different measurement standards, there are still many other issues.

Another issue in the technology industry is diversity. There is great disproportion of gender and ethnicity. Twitter on 7/23/14 released a <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/2014/building-a-twitter-we-can-be-proud-of">blog post</a> that showed great disproportion of gender and ethnicity within the peer companies. The results are intruguing that overall there are 70/30 male/female gender ratio and 60% white/29% asian ethnicity ratio.

The last main issue is the risk of information. Technology advancements such as cloud computing enabled every data to be saved online. As we have recently witnessed regarding Apple's iCloud hack where several of its users (celebrities) found their private photos released in public, data and information as an asset is on the risk. It is important for the industry to take precautionary measures to protect private data and patents from unwanted intruders.
